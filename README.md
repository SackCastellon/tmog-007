# The Mirror of Galadriel!
## Episode #007 - Valid Anagram

Welcome to ***The Mirror of Galadriel***, one of the activities that will follow in the *The Fellowship of Code*. If you haven't been here before, this is a place where programming problems of different types will be proposed to be solved as fast as possible.

Without further ado, we leave you with the next problem. 

Good luck adventurers!

## Statement

Given two strings ``s`` and ``t``, return ``true`` if ``t`` is an anagram of ``s``, and ``false`` otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

***Constraints***
> 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
> </br> ``s`` and ``t`` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Examples

*Example 1*
> **Input**: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
> </br> **Output**: true

*Example 2*
> **Input**: s = "rat", t = "car"
> </br> **Output**: false

## Extra

Here you can find ***the spice*** if you want to show off, with a slightly more difficult challenge.

- What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
